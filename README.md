## Introduction

In this paper, we propose the LiDAR Distillation to bridge the domain gap induced by different LiDAR beams for 3D object detection. In many real-world applications, the LiDAR points used by mass-produced robots and vehicles usually have fewer beams than that in large-scale public datasets. Moreover, as the LiDARs are upgraded
to other product models with different beam amount, it becomes challenging to utilize the labeled data captured by previous versionsâ€™ high-resolution sensors. Despite the recent progress on domain adaptive 3D
detection, most methods struggle to eliminate the beam-induced domain gap.

Results of single-dataset adaptation on KITTI dataset with PointPillars (moderate difficulty). For SECOND-IoU and PV-RCNN, we find that it is easy to raise cuda error on low-beam data, which is may caused by the bug in spconv. Thus, we do not provide the model but you can still run these experiments with the [yamls](tools/cfgs/kitti_models).
